### **Websockets**
---

Frontend has implemented a connection through websocket.io-client to update the list of news in news view, when a new is added to the database. 

Backend has implemented a connection through websockets that observes any change in the database and in case of 'insert' sends a ping to the frontend to update the data.

## Design
---


This application has been developed following the indications of the document complying with all the points.

Initial time was spent specifying and listing the requirements and translating them into tasks:

- Design the endpoints with the necessary logic
- Make a front design schema by modules
- Study the reusability of components

Here some captures of this designing tasks:

## Future developments/TO DO
---

Some TO DO are defined as comments in the code

- Use babel to be able to use ecmaescript in browsers
- Change EC6 import and export in backend
- Uncouple the components and use context to provide the data of each view
- Use DAO, DTO
- Use pagination instead of scrollable, I know that it is not efficient because all the news is brought every time, but due to lack of time I left this structure, in the code it is specified in comments how to implement it in fact I had made the GET endpoint with this structure, as for the frontend a bootstrap pagination and a useState would have been used for the page number
